eclipse-iprojectdecorator
=========================
This plugin adds the full filesystem path to any IProject resource shown in the Package Explorer of Eclipse.  

I wrote it to help ease my tasks at work, since I spend a lot of time Eclipse performing builds of Java applications.  I prefer not to use a Git plugin for Eclispe, so this plugin I wrote does the trick by displaying path info, which allows me to see what branch of a Git project is currently imported and building.

To install, you may download the JAR file in the *builds* folder, or download the source and export it yourself.  Then, places the JAR file in the <eclipse_root>/plugins folder.  Next, restart Eclipse (make sure your use *-clean* on restart to refresh the plugins).

I hope you find this plugin useful!
